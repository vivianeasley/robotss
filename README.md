# A simple personal RSS feed reader

Mostly a rush job, I wrote this for myself when the RSS reader I used went full-on ads crazy town. The site is easy for anyone to use with a free rss2json API key.

## Features
- Responsive-ish
- Darkmode
- Default feeds that can be toggled on and off
- Fully customizable
- Using local storage to only make requests when needed
- ability to load RSS feeds from another computer

## To use
Go to the phenomenal service [rss2json](https://rss2json.com/plans) and signup for a free account. When you load the demo input your API key. The page should load after that.

## To Run locally
npm install
npm run dev
Navigate to localhost:8000
Enter your rss2json API key
